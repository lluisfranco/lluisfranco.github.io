            </div>My 5 minutes of glory üòÇ Yesterday the guys of MS published my brief interview MVP site. However, it is not the full version, that I copy here.
About Llu√≠s Franco Born in Barcelona (Spain) with more than 20 years of experience in the software development sector, now lives in Andorra for the past 15 years with his family. Lluis holds a number of Microsoft official certifications such as MCP and MCTS and has been recognized as MVP for the past 10 years due to his active participation and moderation in the MSDN forums since 1997.]]></description>

            </div>MVP of the year 2011 Surprised. Puzzled. Amazed. These are the words that define better my current feelings.
However, while writing these lines I‚Äôm just realizing I have a blissful smile, or maybe just a stupid smile. Why? Because I just received an email from Lisa Feigenbaum (Microsoft Community Program Manager) with this message:
 ‚ÄúCongratulations on being awarded C# MVP of the Year based on your contributions in 2011!‚Äù]]></description>
