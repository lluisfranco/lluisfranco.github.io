            </div>Extracting system icons from Win32 Overwiew Hi, everyone! :)
In a recent project I was required to show a list of files with their associated icons. It doesn&rsquo;t sounds quite difficult, and in fact it is not. Except if you have to deal with files in network paths or you want to get different icons sizes, apart the typical 32×32. And well, that was the case <i class="fas fa-grin-beam-sweat" aria-hidden="true"></i>
If you only need local files and sizes of 32x32 píxels you can achieve this using the static method ExtractAssociatedIcon in the class System.]]></description>

            </div>The scenario In business applications it’s very common checking if the current user is member of the ‘domain administrators’ role of your company. For example, recently I had to check if the current user has administrative privileges in order to show some advanced configuration options.
IsInRole To acomplish this we could use the IsInRole method from the WindowsPrincipal class. This method checks if an user is member of a Windows role and returns a bool value.]]></description>
