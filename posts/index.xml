            </div>Extracting system icons from Win32 Overwiew Hi, everyone! :)
In a recent project I was required to show a list of files with their associated icons. It doesn&rsquo;t sounds quite difficult, and in fact it is not. Except if you have to deal with files in network paths or you want to get different icons sizes, apart the typical 32√ó32. And well, that was the case <i class="fas fa-grin-beam-sweat"></i>
If you only need local files and sizes of 32x32 p√≠xels you can achieve this using the static method ExtractAssociatedIcon in the class System.]]></description>

            </div>MVP of the year 2011 Surprised. Puzzled. Amazed. These are the words that define better my current feelings.
However, while writing these lines I‚Äôm just realizing I have a blissful smile, or maybe just a stupid smile. Why? Because I just received an email from Lisa Feigenbaum (Microsoft Community Program Manager) with this message:

            </div>The scenario In business applications it‚Äôs very common checking if the current user is member of the ‚Äòdomain administrators‚Äô role of your company. For example, recently I had to check if the current user has administrative privileges in order to show some advanced configuration options.
IsInRole To acomplish this we could use the IsInRole method from the WindowsPrincipal class. This method checks if an user is member of a Windows role and returns a bool value.]]></description>

            </div>Gettings all controls from a container That&rsquo;s the question How many times have you ever heard something similar? :)
 How to clear the content of all the textboxes in a form?
 The question may vary a littles bit but it&rsquo;s always related to obtain all controls of a determined type (Button TextBox, etc) in a form or maybe in another type of container like a Panel or user control.]]></description>
