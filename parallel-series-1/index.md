# Parallel Series


## Prologue

There are news in each .NET framework version and each one of us fall in love with -at lest- one of these. It happened to me with [Generics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172192.aspx) in version 2.0, [extension methods](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx) in version 3.0 and [LINQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx) in version 3.5. Now with version 4.0 it's time to fall in love again, this time with the [Task Parallel Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx).

When I got the first preview, one of the first things I did was to learn about that new Task Parallel Library. Firstly because the announced death of [Mooreâ€™s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), and second because I appreciate any help when creating or debugging with multi-threading programs :smile:

In the next posts I'm going to start from scratch to TPL advanced topics. My goal will be: one example at least in each post. Because humans -and don't forget we developers inherits human base class- learn by example.

See you soon,
